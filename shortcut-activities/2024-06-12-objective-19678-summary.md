## üîç Overview
This is a summary of the current state and recent changes (last 2 weeks) for all epics under Shortcut Objective **19678: "Squad 6 - 2025 2nd Third (March to June)"** and how these changes have affected their health status.

### 1. <span style="color:#e67e22">Replace Algolia with Typesense</span>  
**Status:** <span style="color:#2980b9">In Progress</span>  
**Health:** <span style="color:#e74c3c">At Risk</span> üö© (as of June 2, 2025) ‚Äî _"De Prioritized"_  
**Recent:** Epic started June 10, 2025. 1/10 stories done.  
**Effect:** Deprioritization led to "At Risk" health despite some activity.

**Why At Risk:**
- The epic was **deprioritized** (explicitly noted in health status), so resources or focus have shifted away from it.
- Only 1 of 10 stories is complete, with most still in the backlog or just started.
- No evidence of recent blockers or technical issues, but the lack of progress and deprioritization are the main reasons for risk.

**Missing/Expected Data:**
- No explicit blockers or technical challenges are documented in the stories.
- Would expect to see comments or tasks indicating why deprioritization occurred (e.g., resource reallocation, dependency on other work, or business decision).
- No recent comments or updates explaining the path forward or a new ETA.

### 2. <span style="color:#e67e22">CI - NX for Build</span>  
**Status:** <span style="color:#2980b9">In Progress</span>  
**Health:** <span style="color:#e74c3c">At Risk</span> üö© (as of June 9, 2025)  
**Recent:** 6/13 stories done. Health downgraded to "At Risk" on June 9.  
**Effect:** Slow progress or blockers likely caused the risk status.

**Why At Risk:**
- Progress is **slow**: 6 of 13 stories are done, but several key stories remain unstarted or in progress.
- Multiple stories are marked as "blocked" or "on hold" (e.g., "Use NX for DB Seed project" is labeled ONHOLD).
- Some stories have failed builds or require review (e.g., PRs in draft, failed build status).
- There are technical blockers:
  - "Use NX for build process" and "Determine what pipeline looks like with NX" are both marked as blockers, and some tasks are incomplete.
  - Comments indicate the work was paused due to other priorities.
  - Some PRs are in draft or have failed builds, which can delay progress.

**Missing/Expected Data:**
- Would expect more detailed comments on why certain stories are blocked or on hold (e.g., specific technical issues, waiting on external teams, or resource constraints).
- No clear ETA or mitigation plan is documented for the remaining work.
- Would benefit from a summary of dependencies or cross-team impacts.
